## The name

Like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), Marcel is named after a [great writer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust). It's also a riff on [parcel](https://parceljs.org/), the application bundler â€” but, like, for Markdown. Parcel + Markdown = Marcel. Also, I have a very close friend named Marcel who happens to be a philosopher. Oh, and I found a free slot for `marcel` on [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/marcel).
